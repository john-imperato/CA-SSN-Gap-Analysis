# California Sentinel Sites for Nature (CA-SSN) Gap Analysis

This repository supports the **CA-SSN Gap Analysis**, a project evaluating how well California’s network of Sentinel Sites represents the state’s ecological and climatic diversity. The analysis focuses on identifying geographic and environmental gaps in biodiversity and climate monitoring coverage across more than 100 standardized sites managed by the University of California Natural Reserve System (UCNRS), the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and Pepperwood Preserve.
